# Underwriting
Many people struggle to get loans due to insufficient or non-existent credit histories. And, unfortunately, this population is often taken advantage of by untrustworthy lenders. The vision was to broaden financial inclusion for the unbanked population by providing a positive and safe borrowing experience. In order to make sure this underserved population has a positive loan experience, a variety of alternative data--including telco and transactional information was used--to predict their clients' repayment abilities. 
Statistical and machine learning methods were used to make probabilistic predictions on the trustfulness of client being a defaulter or not.
